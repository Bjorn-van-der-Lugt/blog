    <h2>Why One Should Start Early</h2>
    <p>Starting from roughly the age of 30, a man's testosterone levels slowly begin to decline, on average, by 1% every year. Of course, lifestyle plays a significant role in determining the exact numbers. Testosterone is crucial for building muscle ("steroids" are essentially synthetic testosterone and its derivatives). Therefore, it's easy to see why building the body is much easier early in life. I say "build the body" because much more is being developed than just muscles. On the physical level, this includes muscle size and strength, longevity, overall health, the strength of connective tissue, and bone density.</p>

    <figcaption>"Hercules at the Crossroads" by Annibale Carracci (1596) – A symbolic depiction of Hercules facing a choice between Virtue (a path of hardship and greatness) and Vice (a path of pleasure and ease). The painting captures the timeless struggle between discipline and temptation, a theme that mirrors the journey of self-improvement and strength-building.</figcaption>
    <p>Another critical aspect to highlight is that certain movement patterns and skills are more easily learned when young. As the saying goes, "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." Fitness training enhances neuromuscular coordination, allowing different muscle groups to work together more efficiently. Moreover, the body begins to recycle old and damaged cells when under high stress due to physical demand or fasting. In other words, overall health is built alongside physical capabilities.</p>

    <p>Building all of this is much easier earlier in life when testosterone peaks. This advantage is not only due to testosterone itself but also because younger individuals typically have fewer responsibilities and are less prone to injuries.</p>

    <p>A very urgent piece of advice I’d like to give to young readers is this: don’t sit around waiting for the perfect moment. Start as soon as you can.</p>

    <p>Another reason for starting early lies in the principle of myonuclear retention. When you build muscle, your muscle cells add nuclei to support growth. Even if you stop training and lose muscle size, these nuclei remain for a long time, allowing for quicker regrowth when you resume training. A 2016 study suggests that myonuclei can persist for 15 years or more in some cases, meaning the effects of muscle memory are long-lasting. A previously trained individual can regain muscle in weeks or months, whereas building the same amount of muscle initially might take 6 to 12 months. Additionally, the brain and nervous system retain the motor skills and patterns required for lifting, enabling faster progress when you start again.</p>

    <p>In short, during the period in your life when you are most susceptible to muscle gain, you have the opportunity to build a good physique that will benefit you throughout your life. Even if you lose it, regaining it will be much easier.</p>

<h2>Why You Should Still Start When You’re Older</h2>

    <figcaption>"Saturn Devouring His Son" by Francisco Goya (1823) – A raw and terrifying vision of time as a devourer, inspired by the myth of Saturn, who consumed his children to avoid losing power. This grotesque image reflects the inevitability of decay, the passage of time, and the desperate struggle against one's own decline. A haunting reminder that strength must be built before time takes its toll.</figcaption>
    <p>Yes, it is best to start young. That said, this should never be an excuse for my older readers. I don’t care how old you are—whether you’re 40, 60, or even 100—this part of your life needs to be in order. The earlier you start, the better, but it is never too late to take control and improve your physical fitness. It might be harder, but it is still absolutely possible.</p>

    <p>To end this post, let me share two major examples of individuals who achieved remarkable transformations later in life:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dr. Jeffrey Life:</strong> At the age of 60, he transformed his body through fitness and a healthy lifestyle. He became famous for his muscular physique later in life, inspiring others with the slogan, "What’s your excuse?"</li>
        <li><strong>Sam "Sonny" Bryant Jr.:</strong> He began bodybuilding at the age of 44 and went on to become a natural bodybuilding icon in his 70s, proving that age is no barrier to achieving peak physical fitness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, whether you’re young or old, the time to start is now. Build your temple and ensure it stands strong for the rest of your life.</p>
